## Hide Cursor

### Install from the [GNOME Shell Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6727/hide-cursor/)


GNOME Shell extension to hide the cursor on inactivity

For use on Wayland, since `unclutter`, `unclutter-xfixes` and `xbanish` only work on X11.

**This branch is a [backport to GNOME Shell 42 by glitsj16](https://github.com/elcste/hide-cursor/issues/9). *I have not tested it!* Feedback welcome (does it work with GS 43 or 44?).**
